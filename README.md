## About
I have some plans to "recover" InTouchApp for Windows Phone. :)

So, this repo is my attempt to remake discontinued InTouchApp  WP8.1 app onto real UWP app. 


## About
Very early bird; draft UWP application (only "sketch" at now...)


## Tech/dev details
- Platforms: UWP only
- Targets: x64, x86, ARM
- OSes: Windows 10 (Mobile); 
- Min. Win. OS build: 15063

## Status / my 2 cents
- ForPDA decomp. completed but over 100500 bugs there ;
- Draft. Prototype / Build failed ;
- Work-in-progress .
